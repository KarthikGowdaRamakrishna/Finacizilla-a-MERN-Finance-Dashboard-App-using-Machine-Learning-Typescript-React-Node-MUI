Welcome to the Finance Dashboard App repository! This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for visualizing yearly expenses and predicting revenue for the next year based on historical data patterns. Whether you're managing a business, overseeing operations, or planning for the future,

MERN Finance Dashboard App that has Machine Learning Predictions. The frontend consists of Vite for the starter application, Redux Toolkit for state management, Material UI for the component library, and Recharts for Charts. For the backend I have used Node Js as our runtime, Express Js as our backend framework, and MongoDB for our database.

This how the dashboard looks for the visualization of data to draw valuable Insights and track the expenses and revenue
